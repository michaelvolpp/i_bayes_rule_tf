# The Improved Bayesian Learning Rule for Finite Gaussian Mixtures in TensorFlow 2

## What is this?
This is a Tensorflow 2.0 implementation of the improved Bayesian learning rule for Finite Gaussian Mixtures, as proposed by [Lin et al., "Handling the Positive-Definite Constraint in The Bayesian Learning Rule", ICLR 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10060).
